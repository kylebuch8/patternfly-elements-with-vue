        <pfe-accordion-panel>
          <p>
            There is legislation that decides what you can conjure and what
            you can not. Because things that you conjure out of thin air
            will not last, it is illegal in the wizarding world.

          <p>
            <a href="#">The characters in the portraits</a> are not actually
            ghosts. They mainly are there just to repeat common phrases or

            they depict. A portrait of his parents would not be of much help
            to Harry.

            Why is Harry considered a half-blood if both of his parents
            could use magic?

        <pfe-accordion-panel>
          <p>
            Because Harry's grandparents were not able to do magic. This is
            generally frowned upon by those who consider themselves pure,
            such as the Malfoy's or other antagonists.

            No! It has been revealed that there are actually 11 long
            established and prestigious schools around the globe. These
            include Castelobruxo in the rainforest of Brazil, Durmstrang
            Institute (whereas nobody is certain of it’s whereabouts), and
            Ilvermorny, right here in the United States.

            Harry and Hermione are at the Ministry: he ends up leading the
            Auror department. Ron helps George at the joke shop and does
            very well. Ginny becomes a professional Quidditch player and
            then sportswriter for the Daily Prophet.
